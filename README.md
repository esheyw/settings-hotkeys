# Settings Hotkeys
A simple module providing three hotkeys and one setting to modify their behaviour:
## The Setting
If `Focus Before Close` is false (the default state), the given hotkey will toggle the window open/closed, regardless of current focus (assuming your key presses aren't getting eaten by the search input element.)
If it is true, and the window in question is not the `ui.activeWindow`, it will be brought to fore instead of closed.

## The Hotkeys

### Open Configure Settings
Default: `Alt + Z`

### Open Configure Controls
Default: `Alt + X`

### Open Module Management
Default: `Alt + Shift + Z`
